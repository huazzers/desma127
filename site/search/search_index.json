Some bugs will only reveal themselves in a build, so make sure to catch those in advance of the deadline. A broken game will affect your project grade. Submission Checklist Before class on the day of the project deadline The following items should be handed in through the project submission form before class starts : Project Title Project Statement -- can be descriptive of the piece, but should mostly focus on your motivation for making it. Instructions for interactivity -- which buttons do I press? Project build for WINDOWS , zipped with the folder and .dll file that Unity will export along with the .exe file. Exported Unity package , with the file extension (.unitypackage). By 11:59PM on the day of the project deadline: Submit the following visual documentation of your project in the same submission form: \u26a0\ufe0f DO NOT SHOW THE UNITY EDITOR IN YOUR VISUAL DOCUMENTATION. at least ONE animated GIF of your project in motion, roughly 600 pixels wide, ideally under 5MB in size. at least TWO stills from your project (1920x1080). (Optional) Recording of gameplay. Roughly 60 seconds, long enough to demonstrate how your game is played (1920x1080, mp4/h.264) Tools for Visual Documentation Animated GIFs Animated GIFs are durable and easy to view (though not always small in size). In this course we will use animated GIFs as a quasi-archival format for animated visual material. Preferably, they should be 600 pixels wide and under 5MB in file size. I personally use and recommend ScreenToGif , which is a good tool for quickly making a gif. Photoshop, Premiere, AfterEffects, or other video editors can also export gifs. You may also find the following free tools helpful: EzGif.com is an online GIF maker, editor, and compressor. Great for reducing the file size of GIFs. LICEcap is a badly-named free OSX app which can capture an area of your screen and save it directly to an animated GIF. Online-convert.com offers a browser tool for converting videos into GIFs. Screenshots and Screen Recordings Make a build first and run it full screen to capture images and video of your project. For screen recordings, OBS works very well. You may also use the Unity Recorder to capture single frames and videos from within the Unity Editor. Built-in OS screenshot shortcuts: Windows To take a screenshot and automatically save the file, press the Windows key + PrtScn . Your screen will go dim and a screenshot of your entire screen will save to the Pictures > Screenshots folder . Also consider the snipping tool, which is a convenient way to capture a portion of your screen. Mac To take a screenshot, press Shift + Command + 3 . If you see a thumbnail in the corner of your screen, click it to edit the screenshot. Or wait for the screenshot to save to your desktop. By default, screenshots save to your desktop with the name \u201dScreen Shot [date] at [time].png.\u201d How to export projects from Unity Before we export anything... Project / Player Settings for Unity Build Go to Edit > Project Settings > Select the Player tab . Here's some settings you may customise: Product Name - Set this to your project title. This will be the name of the executable file (.exe). Default Icon and Cursor - Set the executable file icon and in-game cursor. Resolution and Presentation - You may calibrate whether your game application runs in the background, and whether it opens in fullscreen or windowed view. Building your project Start by opening the build settings under File > Build Settings . Add all the scenes you want to include in your project by clicking and dragging them from your assets folder to \u201cScenes in Build\u201d (also remove any scenes you don\u2019t want to include). The topmost scene in this list will be the first to play when starting the game. Create a Windows build by changing Target Platform to \u201cWindows\u201d and clicking build. After the build has finished, locate the folder containing all the files and folders that Unity created. The build needs all these folders, exes, and dlls to run properly. Rename this folder as \"YourName_Project123_Build\" , then compress it into a zipped folder. You will upload this .zip folder on itch.io and submit it for documentation. Unity Packages Read the official documentation for exporting and importing Unity packages . Rather than creating a zip file of your entire Unity project folder, you can save a lot of time (and space) by exporting only the assets for the scenes, materials, prefabs, etc. that you want to share. This is called exporting an asset package. Exporting Unity Packages You have two options: Find your scene file in the Project tab, right click the scene, and click \u201cExport Package\u2026\u201d OR Click Assets > Export Package\u2026 In the window that opens, de-select any assets that you don\u2019t want to include. Be careful that you don\u2019t exclude anything required to run your scene. If you only had your scene selected when clicking Export Package\u2026 , the window will only display the assets directly used in that scene. You can select entire folders, or even the top level Assets folder to bring up more assets to include in the export. Select None , then click Include dependencies box to include all assets used inside your scene. Finally, click Export\u2026 to save your unitypackage file. Name this Unity Package \"YourName_Project123.unitypackage\" Importing Unity Packages To import a package into another project, double click the \u201c.unitypackage\u201d file with a project open and an import window will appear. You can also click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package\u2026 to select the unitypackage file via explorer/finder.

Prompt -- Two different end scenes from the same minigame in WarioWare, Inc: Mega Microgames! (2003). If the player successfully presses the grab button in the correct timeframe, Wario smiles smugly; if the player misses, Wario sweats embarrassedly. In reference to the original video game series released by Nintendo, WarioWare describes a genre of videogames that feature a compilation of shorter minigames played in quick succession. Each minigame is speedy and simple -- only requiring one or two actions to complete within a seconds-long countdown timer. For our first project, each of you will create a short 2D interactive animation for a warioware-style project. Rather than adapting existing warioware scenes, the intention of this project should be to experiment and explore your own angles of interest (formal and/or conceptual) within the limitations of this framework . While observing the project requirements below, find something meaningful, interesting, or personal to express with animation. Inspirations: Consider the creative decisions made in the following examples that communicate their respective rules and intentions for player interaction: How do the pacing and aesthetic design set the overall tone of the project? What are the cues (audio, visual, social, etc.) that suggest how players should act in this space? How much agency are players allowed to behave and express themselves differently? How does that transform or shape meaning in this project? SPOOKWARE by BEESWAX GAMES. Cooking Mama for Nintendo DS. 10 MISSISSIPPI by Karina Popp. NO ONE CAN STOP MR. DOMINO! (1998) by Artdink. KUUKIYOMI 2: Consider It More! by G-MODE. GIF is captured from this playthrough video by Retort on YouTube. PLUG & PLAY by Mario von Rickenbach and Michael Frei, based on the latter's identically titled film . Requirements Your interactive animation is required to: have a \"start scene\" ; Keep any textual instructions within 1~3 words ! have a timed event , ie. the duration in which a desired action must be completed in order to \"win\", otherwise the player \"loses\"; While 8~12 seconds is standard for warioware minigames, for this project, you're welcome to extend that timeframe up to 2 minutes . have an \"end scene\" be activated at the end of the timed event; implement ONE (1) of the following formats: A. Point-and-click Mouse Interaction Design a 2D environment that reveals a secret or a story when explored with a mouse. Clicking objects will reveal details or surprises. OR B. WASD + Arrow Key Navigation Move a 2D object around an environment with arrow keys / WASD on your keyboard. Collisions in the environment trigger events, such as a new asset appearing or a new scene starting. Requirements to score an A: have sound ; have a concept, story, or meaningful origin behind your decisions; contain at least TWO (2) assets that have active and idle states; implement 2D animation techniques . Your project is NOT required to: have a series of \"minigame\" scenes, nor have a comedic tone and speedy pace like a classic warioware minigame; use explicit videogame-y language like \"WIN\", \"LOSE\", \"SCORE\", or visible countdown timer UI -- consider the premise of your project, then choose your words and images wisely... or get really experimental with it! implement both point-and-click mouse interaction AND WASD + arrow key navigation... but you can if you want to! Tips: Use score keepers or collision / trigger collider events to activate your ending scenes. Consider having different ending scenes for different outcomes , eg. whether the player successfully completes the minigame within the time limit. Start from the scripts that will be shared in our tutorials , and then make any necessary edits from there later on. Consider your audience and how it should be interacted with. What do you want them to feel/know/discover? How can you design your project and interactions to communicate your story, feelings, or even a joke? Deliverables Sketch/Proposal Bring to class for one-on-one check-in: any sketches, assets, prototypes, and works-in-progress to illustrate your project's direction; a tentative project timeline that breaks down your anticipated project workload into a schedule of smaller checkpoints leading up to the final project deadline, ie. what you aim to get done by when.

Recommended Tools Drawing Tablets While drawing tablets are not required for this class, they are essential for anyone who intends to incorporate digital drawing in their work now and in the future. We have several cintiq monitors in our classroom, and drawing tablets available for checkout at the 4th floor tech support office. These are only available for classroom use. If you intend to purchase one for personal use outside the classroom , here are some recommendations: Wacom tablets are the most reliable brand you can get. Wacom Intuos is one of their cheapest options, it doesn't have a display. Wacom One is more costly and comes with a display. I personally use this one, too. It's a good investment if you like drawing digitally, and can double as a second monitor. Huion H640P is another good budget option. Most surface or tablet devices, and even iPhones, can be paired with desktop PCs and Macs (depending on which OS they're compatible with.) iPads can be paired with Mac using the Sidecar feature , and be paired with PCs with DuetDisplay for a subscription fee. iPhones can mirror your Mac desktop using Yam Pad and a USB connection to your Mac device. You can also get a stylus like this to use your phone as a mini pen tablet. However, this option does not include pen pressure sensitivity.

Email: yo0na@ucla.edu Course Description This course explores traditional and experimental animation techniques that are central to 2D and 3D interactive digital projects and video games. Coursework develops skills and concepts that are integral to animation workflows and game engine animation systems, including traditional animation principles, 2D sprite animation, rigging 2D and 3D game objects, and character controller implementation. Students will experiment with common and alternative input methods for real-time interactivity. Readings, screenings, and in-class gameplay sessions will supplement lessons throughout the quarter. Learning Outcomes Throughout this course, tutorials and studio time center on introducing animation workflows and honing technical skills that are useful for interactive projects. Students will\u2026 Learn classic animation principles and how to design animated assets suited specifically for the Unity game development platform. Activate and navigate 2D sprite and rig-based animations using a mouse, keyboard input (and more) Develop low-poly modeling, rigging, and animation skills in Blender to make CG assets for Unity implementation Use the Animation System program simple object interactions in Unity Lectures, coursework, and readings focus on concept-building, examining artworks, and the performative implications of interfacing, using physical controllers, and using tracked input. Course Outline Unit 1: 2D Techniques and Mouse/Keyboard Inputs Week 1 Introduction to animation principles, loops, and asset creation for 2D workflows. Week 2-3 Introduction to Unity: How to set up interactions with 2D sprite and rig-based animations using mouse and keyboard input. Week 4 Project 1 Presentation Unit 2: 3D Techniques and Custom Inputs Week 5-9 Working with CG modeling, rigging, and experimenting with custom controllers and input methods. Week 10 Project 2 Presentation Assignments and Grading See How To Submit on instructions for submitting Unity projects This is a 5 unit upper division studio class. Expect to work/attend 6 hours a week in class and 9 hours a week outside of class. Course Breakdown Project 1: 30% Project 2: 30% Reading / Media responses: 20% Engagement / Participation / Communication: 10% Attend an Event in the Game Lab: 10% Extra Credit: Seek out an interactive game, performance, installation, or gallery work. Go see it in person and tell me about your experience. Evaluation Criteria Projects In general, your projects should: show consideration for topics discussed in class ; demonstrate at least one skill covered in class; be creatively ambitious enough to push your technical and conceptual practice from your current level of skill and comfort; and must be completed by the specified deadline . We will evaluate your projects based on: Timely submission Did you submit your project on time? (see Late Work for more details.) Completion of Project Deliverables Does your project meet the requirements of the assignment? Conceptual investment / development What are you trying to say with your work? Are you engaging with these ideas at a critical, in-depth, or personal level? Project scope / aesthetic and technical ambition Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically and/or aesthetically? Attention to detail and craft Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc. Reading / Media Responses You will be assigned readings and interactive projects that are related to this course, accompanied by some questions you'll be asked to repsond to. Engagement / Participation / Communication Your engagement and participation grade involves: your timely attendance in class (see Attendance Policy for more details) ; your active contributions in class activities and studio critique; and your responses to technical questions and discussions during class. Most importantly, you'll be graded on your ability to promptly and clearly communicate your needs with us throughout class . If you will be late or absent to class, have questions, need direction, or are struggling with your work, email us so we can help you. Always CC the TA on emails unless you need to speak with me confidentially. Attendance Policy If you are more than 5 minutes late to class (ie. 2:05pm ), you will be marked as late . Two (2) late marks results in an unexcused absence . Unexcused absences will lower your grade. More than three (>3) unexcused absences will result in an automatic fail , and must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If you need to be late or excused, you should inform me AND the TA before class begins . It is also your responsibility to arrange alternative plans with me and the TA for any work you've missed from being absent (eg. attending office hours, sharing project updates, etc.) Late Work On the day the project is due: Projects should be ready to play prior to the beginning of class . Project files and documentation should be submitted by 11:59PM the same day. If you anticipate that you won\u2019t be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us before the due date so we can discuss options. Technology Policy Related to your engagement and participation grade, all phone and laptop usage should only be for class-related work. If you need to use them for anything else during class time, please step outside the classroom and return when you're done. Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content You are expected to develop your own assets for your project submissions. Please don\u2019t use appropriated 3D models, motion capture data, images, or music that you do not have explicit permission to use -- and don't copy games and other projects. With Unity C# scripts, you're encouraged to start with the examples available in the tutorial notes , and then modify them as necessary for your own projects. If there's anything you've taken from somewhere else, note it down as a comment or in your submission so we can help decode what you're doing. No writing code using AI from scratch. The use of prompt-based AI generation programs, including but not limited to ChatGPT, DALLE, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, is strictly not allowed in this class. There are many other reliable solutions and resources available to you, please use this opportunity to explore them. If you're planning to borrow or generate assets from anywhere else, please consult the instructor beforehand AND be able to justify your decision for doing so. While developing early stage prototypes, it is acceptable to use placeholder assets. No credit will be awarded for plagiarised work. All submitted projects should be original and developed within the duration of this class. Remember to acknowledge / cite your tools and sources appropriately in your submission. Campus-wide resources and information Land Acknowledgement The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you\u2019re occupying: https://native-land.ca/ Other resources on land repatriation: UCLA Mapping Indigenous LA -- an online archive of a storymapping research project about indigenous Los Angeles peoples, histories, and geographies from past and present. California History (Winter 2023), Respecting the Ancestors: On Repatriating American Indian Remains -- 2023 essay report on the history of repatriating indigenous peoples remains (mostly a lack thereof), including UC-specific case studies. Decolonization is not a metaphor -- article on what is unsettling about decolonisation as a caution against the loose use of the term in advocacy and scholarship. Know your Rights - ICE on Campus This classroom is a place that honors the experiences of all students regardless of nationality, immigration status, or other factors. I understand that this quarter is likely to be a particularly challenging time for students navigating issues related to immigrant and international student rights. I pledge instructional flexibility including negotiable project grade weighting , online documentation of course materials , and options for remote participation . You do not need to disclose your immigration or visa status to me to access these flexibilities. If you would like to request these accommodations, just let me know. Students who have concerns about their legal rights as immigrants or international students may seek resources via the Undocumented Students Program , IDEAS , and the Dream Resource Center . You may also approach me for advice or help connecting to these resources. In particular, the Undocumented Student Program Legal Services provides legal advice and representation for undocumented UC students or UC students with undocumented family members. You can reach Gina Pech, the Supervising Attorney for the Legal Services Team at gpech@saonet.ucla.edu . If you are detained, or need urgent immigration related legal counsel, you may call Ms. Pech at 424-832-0977 . Additionally, here is the most up-to-date document containing advice and resources for international students at UCLA , including precautionary measures, who to contact in an ICE encounter, and what to do if your visa status is compromised. Commitment to Diversity & Safer Spaces We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit.
