In reference to the original video game series released by Nintendo, WarioWare describes a genre of videogames that feature a compilation of shorter minigames played in quick succession. Each minigame is speedy and simple -- only requiring one or two actions to complete within a seconds-long countdown timer. 

For our first project, each of you will create **a short 2D interactive animation** for a warioware-style project. 

Rather than adapting existing warioware scenes, the intention of this project should be to **experiment and explore your own angles of interest (formal and/or conceptual) within the limitations of this framework**. While observing the [project requirements](#requirements) below, find something meaningful, interesting, or personal to express with animation.

<br>

**Inspirations:**

Consider the creative decisions made in the following examples that communicate their respective rules and intentions for player interaction:

- How do the **pacing and aesthetic design** set the overall tone of the project? 
- What are the **cues (audio, visual, social, etc.)** that suggest how players should act in this space? 
- How much **agency** are players allowed to behave and express themselves differently? How does that transform or shape meaning in this project?

## Requirements

**Your interactive animation is required to:**

1. have a **"start scene"**;

    > Keep any textual instructions within **1~3 words**!

2. have a **timed event**, ie. the duration in which a desired action must be completed in order to "win", otherwise the player "loses";

    > While 8~12 seconds is standard for warioware minigames, for this project, you're welcome to extend that timeframe **up to 2 minutes**. 

3. have an **"end scene"** be activated at the end of the timed event;

4. implement **ONE (1)** of the following formats:

    <blockquote>
    <div class="assign">**A. Point-and-click Mouse Interaction**</div><br>Design a 2D environment that reveals a secret or a story when explored with a mouse. Clicking objects will reveal details or surprises.

    **OR**

    <div class="assign">**B. WASD + Arrow Key Navigation**</div><br>Move a 2D object around an environment with arrow keys / WASD on your keyboard. Collisions in the environment trigger events, such as a new asset appearing or a new scene starting. 
    </blockquote>

<br>

**Requirements to score an A:**

- have **sound**;
- have a **concept, story, or meaningful origin** behind your decisions;
- contain **at least TWO (2)** assets that have active and idle states;
- implement **2D animation techniques**.

<br>

**Your project is NOT required to:** 

- have a series of "minigame" scenes, nor have a comedic tone and speedy pace like a classic warioware minigame;
- use explicit videogame-y language like "WIN", "LOSE", "SCORE", or visible countdown timer UI -- consider the premise of your project, then choose your words and images wisely... or get really experimental with it!
- implement both point-and-click mouse interaction **AND** WASD + arrow key navigation... but you can if you want to!


<br>

**Tips:**

- Use **score keepers or collision / trigger collider events** to activate your ending scenes. 
- Consider having **different ending scenes for different outcomes**, eg. whether the player successfully completes the minigame within the time limit.
- **Start from the scripts that will be shared in our tutorials**, and then make any necessary edits from there later on. 
- **Consider your audience and how it should be interacted with.** What do you want them to feel/know/discover? How can you design your project and interactions to communicate your story, feelings, or even a joke? 

<br>

## Deliverables

#### Sketch/Proposal

Bring to class for one-on-one check-in: 

- any **sketches, assets, prototypes, and works-in-progress** to illustrate your project's direction; 
- a **tentative project timeline** that breaks down your anticipated project workload into a schedule of smaller checkpoints leading up to the final project deadline, ie. what you aim to get done by when.

#### Final Project Build + Documentation

Refer to [How to Submit](how-to-submit.md) for the submission checklist, and instructions for exporting your files correctly.

<br>

## Evaluation

Your final project will be evaluated according to the guidelines listed in the [course syllabus](./syllabus.md/#evaluation-criteria).
