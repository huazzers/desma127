Reading / Media 1 comes in TWO parts: 

1. a solo reading response; and
2. a group media response.

### PART 1: SOLO READING RESPONSE

Read **at least one** of these short essays about ideation/building ideas by these animators published in **Mostly Moving**, an independent animation journal:

- Caleb Wood: [Looking at Shit: Conception of Ideas](https://mostlymoving.com/caleb-wood-essay)
- Jamie Wolfe: [Livin' in the Chaos Loop](https://mostlymoving.com/jamie-wolfe-essay)

Working with games and interactivity means thinking a lot about agencyâ€”what kind of agency will you give or deny your audience? Above, animators Jamie and Caleb talk about forces of **chaos** and **control** in relation to their practices. Take inspiration from Jamie and/or Caleb to formulate **at least three statements (number them!)** that explore how you feel about chaos and control in relation to your interactive practice.

### PART 2: GROUP MEDIA RESPONSE

**In groups of 2~3**, spend at least **30 minutes** with **any TWO (2)** of the following projects: [**LINK TO READING/MEDIA 1 LIST**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxmhYjV7zo1lLmPvBTt7lpUcrBbYTv12-mCrTIunIm8/edit?usp=sharing)

In what ways do the above interactive projects create meaning when they grant or deny you agency? 

Discuss among your group members, take notes, and submit a write-up of your collective response.
